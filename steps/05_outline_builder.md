# STEP 05 — Outline Builder

## Purpose
Create a sufficiently dense outline to support writing a script that meets the target duration for a single micro-topic.

## Target Context
User MUST supply `TARGET_CHANNEL` (e.g. kenh_2) and `TARGET_VIDEO` (e.g. vid_001). Stop and ask if not provided.

## Required reads
Read exactly these paths. DO NOT use global workspace search for abstract filenames to prevent cross-channel configuration contamination.
- channels/{{TARGET_CHANNEL}}/videos/{{TARGET_VIDEO}}/01_intake_spec.json
- channels/{{TARGET_CHANNEL}}/videos/{{TARGET_VIDEO}}/02_topic_strategy.json
- channels/{{TARGET_CHANNEL}}/videos/{{TARGET_VIDEO}}/03_research_brief.json
- channels/{{TARGET_CHANNEL}}/videos/{{TARGET_VIDEO}}/04_policy_report.json

## Required outputs
- 05_outline.json
